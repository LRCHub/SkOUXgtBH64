# Justin Bieber – Habitual

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Flowers open
when they feel the sunlight
Moon rise, tide change
right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly,
you place your lips on my lips
We're each others vice
Our feelings go deep,
deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean,
so we ain't
never rushing through
Our days, or our nights,
ain't no repercussions
Never get enough
I'm only for your consumption
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to, be stable
Earth keeps spinning around,
we're breathing
So thankful
My love for you's habitual ,
yeah
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional
oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
Thats how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual yeah
Just to think that
we've been out here,
this whole time
Working through the seasons
Never cross paths,
till we had a reason
Now lets fast forward, Look up,
a whole new perspective
from life
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinning around
We're breathing
So thankful
My love for you's habitual ,
yeah (So habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional
oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
Thats how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
(Call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual yeah
(Our love is habitual)
