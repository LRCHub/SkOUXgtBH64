Got caught up being caught up
From baggage back in the day
I've got bad luck cause my attitude sucks
And I'm stuck in my old ways
I'm not new again just better at pretending
That I'm not insane
Cause when the summer ends I know my heavy head
Is gonna come back to claim me
Wake up make the same mistakes
Cycles can be hard to break
I know
But I could be your new ritual
Yeah things are going great
Life's been lovely as of late
and you would know If you weren't so
habitual
In a constant limbo trying to get unstuck
But I can't seem to break free
Do you wanna be my friend or do you wanna fuck?
I question it every day
Grey area unaware of the price that I'm gonna pay
When the summer ends and my heavy head
Comes on back to claim me
Wake up make the same mistake
Cycles can be hard to break
I know
But I could be your new ritual
Yeah things are going great
Life's been lovely as of late
and you would know If you weren't so
Habitual
So habitual
You're a little bitch you know
So habitual
Addicted to the ritual
