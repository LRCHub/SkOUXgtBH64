What the fuck is faith
A blank slate stained black
Dissolve into infinity
What the fuck is truth
Painted lies the demise of the mind
Habitual decline
It's hard to see in the voids I create
Spiral down absent of a remedy
A brand new hell
I can't hell escape
Chasing my demons to sleep
Abandon all I know
Until I dissipate
As far as I'm concerned I never got what I gave
Is there something else that I should know?
Before I send my soul to the fire below
This is the gloom of the silence that echoes through
Suppress the feeling I lack peace of mind
No matter where we shine
We leave a shadow behind
Mirrored empathy
The face of hate
Reflected back at me
It's hard to comprehend
Giving all you have
To leave empty handed in the end
Abandon all I know
Until I dissipate
As far as I'm concerned I never got what I gave
Is there something else that I should know?
Before I send my soul below
Abandon all I love
Until I decompose
No grave deep enough to call my own
Is there something else that I should know?
Before I send my soul to the fire below
